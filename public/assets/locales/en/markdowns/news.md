### 08/06/2022 - We really value your participation - thank you!

The Grippenet-Team welcomes you once again to our new platform and we want to thank you for your loyalty to Grippenet! The participatory surveillance platform allows the surveillance of influenza and COVID-19 cases thanks to citizens reporting their flu-like symptoms on a voluntary basis. This allows an earlier detection of possible cases and also the follow-up of mild cases. Therefore, your participation is indispensable, whether or not you are experiencing flu-like symptoms.

If you want to have an overview of the results of previous years, we propose you to read an article written by the Grippenet team and published in 2020: *Richard et al., A New Tool for the Monitoring, Risk-Factor and Vaccination Coverage Analysis of Influenza-Like Illness in Switzerland. Vaccines [Internet]. 2020 Jun 27. Available from: https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/8/3/343.*
