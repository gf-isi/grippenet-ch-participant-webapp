### 22/06/2022 - Increasing numbers of new COVID-19 infections in Switzerland - what you can do to protect yourself and your loved ones

The Federal Office for Public Health recommends five main protective measures to avoid a possible infection with COVID-19 in light of the recent increase in new-infections (1):  
1.	**Get vaccinated**: The vaccine provides the maximum of a possible protection against an infection with COVID-19. It also diminishes the chances of infecting another person as well as the chances of developing Long-COVID.    
2.	**Wear a mask**: COVID-19 is an airborne virus (this means it can be transmitted through aerosols which are set free through breathing, speaking, sneezing or coughing). The wearing of a mask prevents those aerosols from being set free into the air and can therefore interrupt the infection-route.  
3.	**Ventilate your home multiple times a day**: Because COVID-19 is transmitted through the air, the ventilation of indoor-spaces is especially important. If not too cold, keep your windows open to improve air-circulation in indoor-spaces.
4.	**Wash or disinfect your hands**: It is crucial to wash or disinfect (using hand-sanitizer) your hands on a regular basis. This is especially important after touching surfaces which are also touched by other people on a regular basis, after sneezing or coughing or before cooking.
5.	**Cough and sneeze into your handkerchief or elbow**: When sneezing or coughing use a handkerchief or cover your nose and mouth with your elbow. Use a paper-handkerchief and throw it away after you used it. Also wash or disinfect your hands after sneezing/coughing.

### 08/06/2022 - We really value your participation - thank you!

The Grippenet-Team welcomes you once again to our new platform and we want to thank you for your loyalty to Grippenet! The participatory surveillance platform allows the surveillance of influenza and COVID-19 cases thanks to citizens reporting their flu-like symptoms on a voluntary basis. This allows an earlier detection of possible cases and also the follow-up of mild cases. Therefore, your participation is indispensable, whether or not you are experiencing flu-like symptoms.

If you want to have an overview of the results of previous years, we propose you to read an article written by the Grippenet team and published in 2020: *Richard et al., A New Tool for the Monitoring, Risk-Factor and Vaccination Coverage Analysis of Influenza-Like Illness in Switzerland.
