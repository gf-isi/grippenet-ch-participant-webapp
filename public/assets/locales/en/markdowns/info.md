**Influenza viruses**

Influenza viruses (_Myxovirus Influenzae_) are classified in three groups: A, B and C. Group A and B viruses are structurally similar and are coated with surface proteins called haemaglutinins (H) and neuraminidases (N). Type A viruses are classified according to their surface proteins. Over the past 30 years, Influenza epidemics in humans have mainly been caused by type A (H1N1 and H3N2) and type B viruses. Influenza viruses are constantly evolving through antigenic shifts (gene mutations resulting in minor changes) and antigenic breaks (gene reassortments resulting in larger changes). Antigenic shifts are responsible for seasonal variations in the Influenza virus, while antigenic breaks can sometimes lead to the appearance of a (new) pandemic virus.

**Flu symptoms**

Influenza most often manifests itself as an acute respiratory infection. The incubation period is 1 to 3 days. Symptoms usually appear suddenly. The most common symptoms are fever, fatigue, dry cough, sore throat, running nose, body aches and headaches. These symptoms disappear within one to two weeks. Many other symptoms can occur: sneezing, diarrhoea, etc. Several viruses, other than the Influenza virus, can cause these symptoms. It is therefore difficult to make a definite diagnosis of influenza without running a diagnostic medical sample. Influenza can sometimes be described as \"complicated\", when more severe symptoms appear, which can lead to complications. Complications can be caused by the Influenza virus itself or by bacterial superinfections. During seasonal epidemics, complicated Influenza mainly affects the elderly and people who suffer from chronic illnesses. The treatment of influenza is focused on the occuring symptoms: fever medication, painkillers, cough medication. The only specific treatment for Influenza are antiviral drugs. These must be taken early. They reduce the duration and intensity of the symptoms. Still, their use remains limited.

**Seasonal flu epidemics**

Seasonal influenza epidemics occur in the northern hemisphere between September and April and in the southern hemisphere between April and October. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) they cause between 3 and 5 million severe cases and between 250,000 and 500,000 deaths each year. In Switzerland, according to estimates of the _Sentinella_ network, Influenza causes 112,000 to 275,000 medical consultations each year. The epidemic most frequently starts in the end of December, or even in the beginning of January, and lasts on average 9 weeks. Hospitalizations and deaths are mainly among people in risk groups, especially those over 65 years of age. Because of the large number of people affected each year and the sometimes fatal complications of the disease, influenza is a major public health issue.

**Pandemics**

An Influenza pandemic is an influenza epidemic caused by a new Influenza virus that spreads rapidly around the world. Pandemic viruses are similar to seasonal Influenza viruses but due to the lack or poor immunity of the population, pandemic Influenza can cause more severe illness and affect different people than seasonal Influenza. In the 20th century, three influenza pandemics were recorded. In 1918-1919, the "Spanish flu" (A(H1N1) virus) was the most severe pandemic. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimated that at least 40 million people died. The other two pandemics were the "Asian flu" (virus A (H2N2)) and the "Hong Kong flu" (virus A(H3N2)) from 1957-1958. In June 2009, a new pandemic was declared. This was caused by a new Influenza A(H1N1) virus containing genes of porcine, avian and human origin. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the post-pandemic phase in August 2010. The virus has not disappeared, but is now expected to behave like seasonal Influenza viruses. At the end of 2019, a new coronavirus appeared, Sars-Cov-2, which lead the World Health Organisation (WHO) to declare a new ongoing pandemic in March 2020.

**And what about bird flu?**

Influenza viruses can infect species other than humans, including birds (which are reservoirs for Influenza viruses) and pigs (which can be affected by viruses infecting birds, as well as those infecting humans). The A(H5N1) virus infects birds, and exists in a highly pathogenic form. Since 2003, this virus has been circulating in many Asian countries, causing significant bird deaths. In some cases, this virus can be transmitted to humans through birds and cause serious illness. The virus can only hardly be transmitted from human to human.

**Transmission of the disease**

Influenza, like other winter viruses, is transmitted by droplets: droplets released when an infected person coughs or sneezes, droplets on their hands or in their saliva, droplets on contaminated objects (door handles, toys, handkerchiefs, etc.) or droplets in the air.

**Protect yourself and those around you**

The most effective way to reduce the risk of getting infected with Influenza and to protect those around you is to be vaccinated against the disease. The vaccine protects two weeks after the injection, so don't delay getting vaccinated during the autumn to be protected when the virus is circulating. Vaccination must be repeated every year.

To protect yourself from the flu, the Federal Office of Public Health advises the following \"barrier measures\":
- Cover your mouth when you cough, preferably with a handkerchief. Cover your nose and mouth when you sneeze, preferably with a handkerchief. If you don't have a tissue: put your hand in front of your nose and mouth and then wash your hands with soap and water, or hold your arm/armpit in front of your nose and mouth. Blow your nose with disposable tissues. Wash your hands after coughing, sneezing and spitting into a tissue. The tissue should be made of single-use paper, so that it can be disposed of in a rubbish bin, if possible with a bag and a lid.
- Wash your hands regularly with soap and water: wet hands under running water, lather up (if possible with liquid soap) and rub hands until they foam, remember to rub the back of the hand, between the fingers, under the fingernails and the wrists, rinse hands well under running water. Dry your hands with a clean towel (if possible a disposable paper towel or a roll of non-reusable cloth towels).
- Objects and surfaces can be contaminated through the coughs and sputum of people with Influenza. Cleaning of objects and surfaces is an effective way to control contamination: contact surfaces (door handles, furniture, toilet bowls, etc.) should be washed regularly with hot water and soap or usual household products, and objects used by the patient should be cleaned thoroughly and regularly (at least once a day).
- Wearing a hygiene mask is recommended for the following people: sick people at home, when they are not able to keep a distance of 1 metre between people, sick people who have to leave their home (e.g. to visit their doctor), people who cannot keep a minimum distance of 1 metre from a sick person at home, regardless of whether the sick person is wearing a hygiene mask.
- Be very careful when in close contact with others (avoid shaking hands, kissing, sharing objects, etc.).
- Ventilate your home every day.

**The flu vaccine**

Because the flu virus (Influenza) mutates rapidly, the flu vaccine changes every year. The vaccines used in Switzerland are inactivated virus vaccines. In Switzerland, vaccination against influenza is recommended from the age of 6 months for people belonging to a group at risk of complications: people over 65 years old, people with chronic diseases (asthma, lung diseases, cancer, diabetes, etc.), pregnant women or women who have given birth in the last 4 weeks, children born prematurely (from the age of 6 months on and for the first two winters), residents of nursing homes or patients in institutions caring for chronic patients. The flu vaccination is also recommended for people in regular contact with people at risk of complications (listed above, children under 6 months). For details about for whom vaccination is recommended, visit the website of the Federal Office of Public Health.

**What about COVID-19?**

COVID-19 is a disease caused by a coronavirus, SARS-Cov-2, which was first detected in December 2019 in China. The symptoms of COVID-19 are very similar to those of seasonal flu (Influenza): fever, fatigue, cough, sore throat, headache, muscle aches, nasal congestion or conjunctivitis, digestive symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea). More specific symptoms for COVID-19 are loss of taste or smell. COVID-19 can present as an asymptomatic disease or as a disease with mild symptoms, but it can also present as a severe form of the disease, requiring hospitalisation or even a stay in intensive care. It can also result in death. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), 15% of people who get infected with COVID-19 are severely ill and require oxygen, while 5% of patients require to stay in intensive care. Currently, the only way to know if a person is infected with COVID-19 is to take a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-Cov-2. Finally, it should be noted that the incubation period for COVID-19 can take up to 14 days.

**Frequently asked questions about influenza**

**_How serious is the flu (Influenza)?_**

Not everyone is equally affected when infected with the flu (influenza). Generally, healthy young adults recover within 3-7 days, but the virus can do great damage and sometimes lead to life-threatening complications in other susceptible people. This can be caused by the virus itself or by a secondary bacterial infection: pneumonia, myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle), and others (1). People of over 65 years of age, pregnant women, people with certain chronic diseases, infants and premature babies up to the age of two are particularly at risk for complications (2). In Switzerland, seasonal Influenza causes between 111,000 and 331,000 medical consultations each year, several thousand hospital admissions and hundreds of deaths, 90% of which occur in people over 65 (3).

**_How is Influenza transmitted?_**

Influenza is spread through droplets produced by sneezing, coughing and talking. They remain briefly suspended in the air we breathe, mainly in enclosed spaces. Indirect transmission is also possible through surfaces (door handles, touch screens) which are touched by a sick person. On such surfaces the viruses can remain infectious for some time (4). By avoiding touching our nose, mouth or eyes and by washing our hands regularly, we can limit the risk of indirect infection. Note that the flu virus can survive :
- a few minutes on the skin
- a few hours in dried respiratory secretions and on handkerchiefs, clothes, papers, etc.
- up to several days on inert surfaces (door handles, work surfaces, etc.).
The time between infection and the appearance of symptoms (incubation period) is on average 1 to 3 days, but can be up to five days. During this time, the infected person may already be contagious (5). Therefore, in order to limit the transmission of viruses, it is recommended to apply essential hygiene measures at all times (6)(1).

**_What is the difference between a \"real\" flu (Influenza) and a cold? ?_**

A cold is not caused by Influenza viruses, but by other respiratory viruses (rhinovirus, coronavirus, respiratory syncitial virus, parainfluenza virus, etc.) (7). Their symptoms usually appear gradually, unlike Influenza which is usually characterised by a sudden onset. Cold viruses typically cause a cold, sore throat, inflammation of the mucous membranes of the eyes and a low-grade fever (occasionally high in children). Coughing is often part of a cold (1). In contrast, these viruses rarely cause muscle aches, headaches and intense fatigue - all symptoms which are frequently associated with Influenza (8). Sometimes it is difficult to tell the difference between the two illnesses, especially when a flu (Influenza) is mild and uncomplicated. Only laboratory tests can provide a definite diagnosis (1).

**_Why does the seasonal flu epidemic (Influenza-epidemic) occur every year in winter?_**

Respiratory diseases, especially Influenza, are more common in winter than in summer. The explanation is not entirely known, but several factors seem to partly explain this phenomenon (9)(10) :
- Cold weather may lower our immune system's resistance to infections
- Inhaling cold, dry air cools and dries out the mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract, which may inhibit certain defense mechanisms against infections
- Dry, cold weather allows the flu virus to survive longer in the environment (outside of the body)
- In winter, people tend to be more often in populated, poorly ventilated spaces which increases the risk of transmission of respiratory infections.

**_Does wearing more/warmer clothes protect me against the flu (Influenza)?_**

\"Dress warmer, you'll catch a cold\" is a common saying. It is also one of the first reflexes to protect yourself from winter infections. Influenza makes its seasonal appearance during the winter and many hypotheses have been put forward by scientists to explain the link between the cold and Influenza (see previous questions). The hypothesis that cold weather decreases the immune response has been central to the debate, although no scientific study to date has clearly demonstrated such a link. A study conducted on guinea pigs showed that the influenza virus is more stable and remains in the air longer when the air is cold and dry (10). This would put people at greater risk of contracting the virus in cold weather. The same study describes that no change in the immune response was observed in guinea pigs which were exposed to lower temperatures. These findings would lead us to believe that a good coat would not protect us more from the flu in cold weather, although there is still a lack of scientific data on this subject. The solution is to either just stay at home during cold weather or to adopt one or more of the following measures to protect yourself and limit the spread of the virus (3):
- Wash your hands frequently and/or use a hydro-alcoholic solution.
- Cover your mouth and nose with your sleeve or a disposable tissue when coughing or sneezing.
- Avoid shaking hands, kissing, sharing personal belongings or going to crowded places (and avoid taking infants and young children there if possible).
- Ventilate your home every day to change the air.
- Stay at home if you are ill.
The most effective way to protect yourself against Influenza is to be vaccinated. It is recommended for all people at high risk of complications, and for those in close contact with them, whether privately or professionally. All other people who wish to avoid contracting influenza can also be vaccinated, if there are no contraindications.

**_Does the cold kill germs?_**

No! The survival time of bacteria and viruses in the environment depends on several factors, including the degree of humidity, the presence of organic matter (e.g. mucus), exposure to light (ultraviolet light), the chemical composition of the environment (pH, presence of disinfectants) and the temperature (11)(12). Overall, low temperatures slow down the activity and development of bacteria and viruses, prolonging their survival time, without inactivating them. Viruses which cause winter epidemics (Influenza and Gastroenteritis) are therefore not affected by sub-zero temperatures - quite the contrary is true (13). On the other hand, high temperatures destroy most micro-organisms. Therefore, dry or moist heat is used to sterilise medical equipment or to extend the shelf life of food (pasteurisation and appertisation).

**_Can I get the flu (Influenza) by touching an infected surface?_**

Influenza is transmitted through droplets and aerosols emitted by an infected person when coughing and sneezing; and possibly through contact with contaminated surfaces, particularly through the hands. However, the actual risk of infection through this indirect contact route has not been confirmed yet (6). A team of Swiss researchers has investigated the survival time of Influenza viruses on banknotes. Depending on the strain of virus and the amount emitted, the viruses remained active (at room temperature) for a few hours to three days. When the viruses were mixed with mucus, their survival time was greatly increased, up to 17 days (14)! If you just sneezed remember to wash your hands before paying with banknotes for your purchases!

**_What should I do if I have the flu (Influenza)?_**

The first thing to do is to stay at home, rest and stay hydrated. For healthy individuals, symptoms such as fever and muscle pain can be relieved with paracetamol. Aspirin should be avoided in children who suffer from influenza (because of the risk of Reye's syndrome, a condition involving brain and liver damage) (4). In some cases, antiviral drugs can be given as prevention or early treatment to people who are at increased risk of complications in order to reduce the severity of symptoms and the risk of complications. This can be done, for example, in nursing homes to also prevent the spread of the virus (3). Administered within 24-48 hours of the onset of symptoms, it reduces the duration of the illness by an average of one day. It is also essential to carefully apply standard hygiene measures, in order to limit the spread of the disease.

**_When and how long am I contagious if I have the flu (Influenza)?_**

It is estimated that infected individuals are infectious 24-48 hours before the onset of symptoms (4)(3) and remain so for as long as they shed virus, i.e. between 5 and 7 days after the onset of symptoms. The viral shedding phase may be prolonged (>15 days) in children, elderly people and immunocompromised patients, even in the presence of antiviral treatment. However, the risk of infecting others is not always the same. It is highest at the beginning of the disease. It is therefore important to go home as soon as you start to feel ill. One should also not go out for a few days, especially if the flu (influenza) is clinically confirmed (1).

**_When should I see a doctor if I have the flu (Influenza)?_**

The flu (Influenza) does not always require medical support. However, it is advisable to go if symptoms worsen or last for more than one week. People at increased risk of complications should carefully monitor the course of the illness and seek medical attention immediately if any problems arise (3).

**_What are the symptoms of flu (Influenza) and possible complications in children?_**

Children with influenza can have the same symptoms as adults, but with some differences:
- Children tend to have a higher fever and infants may have febrile seizures.
- Stomach upset, vomiting or diarrhoea are also more common in young children.
- Severe muscle pain, especially in the calves, may also occur and the risk of myositis (muscle inflammation) is increased.
- Earache and eye pain are also more common (4)(15).
The most common complications are otitis media, sinusitis, pneumonia (lung infection), bronchitis and bronchiolitis (infection of the very small bronchi). Most of the time, severe complications are due to bacterial superinfections, the same as in adults. Influenza can also cause a "coughing fit", an infection of the throat and vocal cords that makes it difficult to breathe and causes a "hacking" cough. Influenza can be particularly dangerous for children with chronic illnesses, including lung disease (asthma, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, cystic fibrosis) and heart, neuromuscular or autoimmune disease. It is therefore important to seek medical advice early if your child suffers from such a disease (16).

**_When should I see a pediatrician if my child has a flu-like symptoms?_**

Consult your pediatrician **immediately** if :
- You are concerned about your child's condition
- Your child becomes difficult to wake up or seems confused
- Your child has difficulty breathing when resting, is wheezing, has pain in the lungs when breathing or is coughing up blood
- Your child has convulsions

Consult your paediatrician **quickly** if your child:
- has signs of flu-like symptoms and has a lung or heart disease, has an illness or is on treatment that weakens the immune system, takes acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) regularly, or has another chronic illness that requires regular medical care
- has had a very sore throat for 24 hours
- has an earache
- has had a cold for more than 10 days
- has discharge from the eye
- is unable to drink
- has a high fever for more than 3 days
- vomits for more than 4 hours or has severe diarrhoea
- is constantly irritated, does not calm down, is listless and no longer interested in his/her/their usual toys, or, on the contrary, is more sleepy than usual (16) (15).

**_For whom is it recommended to get vaccinated against the seasonal flu (Influenza)?_**

The Influenza vaccination is recommended for:
A) People with an increased risk of serious complications in the event of Influenza (for these people, the vaccination is covered by the compulsory health insurance subject to the amount of the deductible):
- Persons aged 65 and over
- Persons (from the age of 6 months) who are suffering from one of the following chronic diseases: heart disease, lung disease, metabolic disorders affecting heart, lung or kidney function, neurological or musculoskeletal disorders affecting the heart, lung or kidney function, liver disease, kidney failure, asplenia or spleen function, immunodeficiency
- Pregnant women from the 2nd trimester of pregnancy or who have given birth in the previous 4 weeks
- Prematurely born children (born before the 33rd week or with a birth weight of less than 1500 g) from the age of 6 months, during the first two winters after birth
- Residents of nursing homes and institutions for chronically ill patients.

B) Persons who, within their family or within their private or professional activities, are in regular contact with :
- persons in category A
- infants of under 6 months of age (these are at increased risk of complications and cannot be vaccinated because of their very young age)
From the FOPH's Recommendations for Influenza Vaccination (17)

**_I already got the flu shot last year, why do I have to do it again this year?_**

There are two reasons for this. Firstly, viruses mutate regularly, usually requiring vaccines to be adapted each year (18). Secondly, the current flu vaccines are not the most effective: as they do not contain adjuvants and are given in a single dose, their immunity wanes already after a few months. To ensure the best possible protection, a booster vaccination is therefore necessary every year, regardless of whether the viruses have changed or not (2).

**_I had the flu (Influenza) last year therefore I should be immune for a few years, no?_**

Unfortunately not. When we get the seasonal flu, we are protected for a while against re-infection by the same virus, but for the infection with others. However, the Influenza virus exists in different forms in the same season (Influenza A, Influenza B and their subtypes) and it is therefore even possible to get Influenza twice in the same season through two different subtypes (2)(19). Moreover, as the virus can mutate from year to year, even immunity against the same subtype is not guaranteed from year to year! This is why the vaccine is adapted every year and why it remains essential to get vaccinated yearly for real protection (19).

**_Why should I get vaccinated if I am not at risk of complications? Let the body's own antibodies do their work!_**

If you have regular contact in your private, family or professional life with people at high risk of complications, vaccination is recommended (see vaccination recommendations above). By reducing your own risk of becoming ill, you avoid transmitting the disease to these people. For healthy children and healthy young adults, the seasonal flu (Influenza), although unpleasant, is usually uncomplicated. However, people may decide for personal reasons to get vaccinated against Influenza in autumn (work, family, holidays, sports, cultural events).

**_How long is the vaccine fully effective?_**

The vaccine is the most effective for about six months. This is why October and November are a good time to get vaccinated as the flu epidemic usually occurs between December and March (2).

**_How long after vaccination am I protected against the flu (Influenza)?_**

It takes about two weeks to be protected after an unadjuvanted vaccine (2).

**_Can I get the flue (Influenza) from the vaccine?_**

No. The vaccine contains inactive virus fragments which cannot cause disease (3).

**_How could I get the \"flu\" (Influenza) even though I was vaccinated?_**

There may be several explanations for this (1):

a. Insufficient coverage through the vaccine of the circulating virus
The composition of the vaccine is defined in February for the following winter based on the viruses circulating at that time (19). However, these viruses can still mutate and thus change during the summer, resulting in only partial protection through the vaccine. The level of this protection is impossible to predict in advance as it depends largely on the similarity (or differences) between the circulating strains and those included in the vaccine (2).

b. Vaccine efficacy is too low
The effectiveness of vaccination depends on a number of factors such as age, the effectiveness of the vaccine recipient's immune system and the degree to which the Influenza vaccine matches the circulating viruses. The vaccine is less effective in older people or people with chronic illnesses, especially those with weakened immune systems. However, the symptoms are milder and the risk of complications is reduced in these people if they have been vaccinated.

c. Duration for development of immune defense after vaccination
It takes about two weeks for the body to build up its immune defense. If one is infected during this period, one can still get sick the flu (Influenza).

d. Adverse reactions
Approximately 5-10% of vaccinated people may experience reactions such as fever, muscle pain or a feeling of unease after receiving the vaccine. This reaction is the result of the stimulation of the immune system. It is harmless and disappears within one or two days. It is not a real flu (influenza) caused by the vaccine.

e. Chills
Vaccination only protects against the Influenza viruses contained in the vaccine, but not against other germs/viruses that circulate in winter and cause colds (3). The latter can cause symptoms that can be confused with those of Influenza. However, colds do not lead to (life-threatening) complications like an infection with Influenza.

**_What are the potential side effects of the flu vaccine?_**

The most common side effects (occuring in 10-40% of people who have been vaccinated) are redness or pain around the injection site. The following symptoms may also occur within 5-10% of people who have been vaccinated: fever, muscle pain, headache or mild nausea. These reactions are mild and disappear after a few days. When the vaccination causes an allergy, it is rare for this to result in skin rashes, oedema, asthma. It is even rarer for an immediate allergic reaction (anaphylactic shock) to occur as a result of the vaccine (less than 1 in 10,000). Such reactions are usually related to hypersensitivity to egg-proteins. The Guillain-Barré syndrome, an autoimmune disease, is seen in 1 in 1,000,000 vaccinated people. It is important to note that there is a much higher risk of suffering serious complications from influenza than from adverse events related to the vaccination (3)(17).

**_Is the flu vaccine safe for pregnant women?_**

Pregnancy and breastfeeding are not contraindications for the vaccination. Furthermore, the risk of developing severe illness and complications from an Influenza infection is greatly increased in pregnant people and newborns. Several studies show that newborns are protected through maternal antibodies when vaccinated during pregnancy. This protection can reach an efficacy of 85% during the first two months of life and then gradually decreases to 30% within six months (20).

**_When should the flu vaccine not be given?_**

This vaccine is contraindicated in cases where severe allergic reactions (f.e. anaphylactic shock) to any of the vaccine's components have been observed during previous vaccinations. It should also not be given to patients which have known severe allergies to chicken-egg-proteins. On the other hand, for children with a general egg allergy, the Influenza vaccine poses a low risk of adverse reactions and can be given if necessary under medical supervision and after a skin test which is conducted within a medical consultation previous to the vaccination (21). The Influenza vaccine is not recommended for infants under 6 months of age (17). For people who are sick with high fever, vaccination is usually delayed, otherwise the vaccine protection can be diminished. Influenza vaccination during pregnancy and breastfeeding is safe and recommended for the protection of the mother and the newborn (1).

**_Is the vaccination cost reimbursed by the health insurance?_**

Flu vaccination is covered by compulsory health insurance (basic insurance) for all people who are at increased risk of complications, subject to the amount of the deductible.
Taken from the FOPH's frequently asked questions on seasonal influenza (1).

**_Where and when can I get vaccinated?_**

You can get vaccinated at your doctor's office, at the vaccination centre of a nearby hospital and at pharmacies (list of pharmacies that provide vaccination at: www.vaccinationenpharmacie.ch). Some companies also offer free vaccination to their employees. Ideally, the vaccination should be carried out between mid-October and mid-November, so that the immune system has time to build up its immunity before the influenza-wave begins. In fact, a national influenza vaccination day is held every year in early November. During this day, vaccination is offered by some doctors and pharmacists on a voluntary basis and at a recommended flat rate. More information about the influenza-vaccination can be found at: www.sevaccinercontrelagrippe.ch.

**_I have the flu (Influenza) and my doctor didn't prescribe me antibiotics! Why not?_**

Antibiotics only have an effect on bacteria but the flu (Influenza) is caused by a virus. Therefore they do not have an effect on the seasonal flu except in the case of a secondary bacterial superinfection (particularly in the case of pneumonia). In such a case your doctor will certainly prescribe them.
Taken from the FOPH's frequently asked questions on seasonal flu (1).

**_I have the flu (Influenza) and my doctor didn't prescribe me any antiviral medications! Why not?_**

For a healthy person, antiviral drugs (Relenza®, Tamiflu®, etc.) are not necessary. But they can be prescribed to people which are at increased risk of complications in order to reduce the severity of symptoms and complications of the disease. They can also shorten the illness by one or two days. To be fully effective, these medicines must be taken within 48 hours of the onset of the first symptoms, i.e. in many cases even before you know you have the flu. In Switzerland, they are only available with prescriptions.
Taken from the FOPH's frequently asked questions on seasonal flu (1).

**_Is there a link between smoking and the risk of catching the flu (Influenza)?_**

Inhaled cigarette smoke reduces the respiratory tract's ability to defend itself against external infections. Smokers are therefore more vulnerable to respiratory infections, particularly to infections caused by the Influenza virus (22). Numerous studies show that people who smoke are at greater risk of contracting Influenza. In addition, when a person who smokes gets infected with Influenza, the risk for complications is higher than for people who do not smoke. The good news is that the flu vaccine appears to be just as effective for people who smoke as for people who do not smoke (9).

**_I have a healthy lifestyle and I'm generally healthy, isn't that enough to avoid the flu (Influenza)?_**

No, although a healthy lifestyle and a balanced diet can strengthen your immune system and thus help your body fight certain infections. Hand washing and normal hygiene measures can reduce the risk of infection. However, this is not enough to protect yourself against the flu (Influenza). The flu vaccine is so far the most effective and the simplest and safest way to avoid catching the flu in winter (3).

**_How is the flu (Influenza) being surveilled in Switzerland?_**

Currently, the main surveillance system for Influenza is the _Sentinella_ system. This is a network of 150-250 primary care physicians (including pediatricians, general practitioners and internists) who voluntarily report the number of suspected Influenza cases and the total number of patients they see every week to the Federal Office of Public Health. From these numbers, the number of influenza-related consultations per 1000 consultations can be calculated for each week and then extrapolated to estimate the total number of cases in the Swiss population (1)(23). Doctors in the _Sentinella_ network can also send samples of suspected Influenza-cases for analysis to the National Reference Centre for Influenza (CNRI) based at the HUG (University Hospital Geneva). The latter ensures the diagnosis of Influenza A and B for the samples received (24).
